I am an enthusiastic self-learner deeply passionate about education and technology.

Since a young age, I've embraced the ethos of entrepreneurship as the path forward. Through overcoming fears, challenging limiting beliefs, and learning from every obstacle, I've evolved into a visionary individual. This journey has equipped me with leadership acumen, effective communication skills, adaptability to change, and a keen eye for opportunities within challenges. Every day, I reinforce the belief that **If you want to change the fruits, you will first have to change the roots**

... Continuous learning ðŸ¤“
