## Hello !

I'm an avid self-learner and passionate about education. I'm currently a software engineering student at [Ã‰cole 42 QuÃ©bec](https://42quebec.com).

I am a cheerful, enthusiastic, committed, enterprising man, passionate about life.

From a young age I learned that entrepreneurship is the Way. Overcoming fears, limiting beliefs, and learning from each challenge has shaped me as a Man of Vision, with leadership skills, assertive communication, adaptation to change, and seeing the opportunities in each Obstacle. I learn every day that **If you want to change the fruits, you will first have to change the roots**.

... Continuous learning ðŸ¤“
